# This is simple dictionary api <sub>(it is a part of big future project)</sub>

It contains
```
sql file - to create and fill your own database with any words and pairs you want (used MySQL)
controller - to track specific queries
configuration with configuration class (not xml)
entities - to work with databases rows like objects
repository/dao
service
aspects - to log
exception handlers
logs
```

The main idea is to use this rest api for my main project
